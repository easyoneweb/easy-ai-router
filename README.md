# Easy-AI-Router

Server application with REST API that provides access to different providers or routers of AI models. Currently supported providers and routers: 
- OpenRouter.

## Setup

```bash
go mod tidy
```

Environment variables should be put in .env file.

## Production

Build the application for production:

```bash
go build
```

## Environment variables

Application is using environment variables. You have to define:

- PORT on which the server will run locally.
- ACCESS_OPENROUTER_API_KEY to access application's REST API for OpenRouter.
- OPENROUTER_HOST is host URL for OpenRouter REST API.
- OPENROUTER_API_KEY is api key for OpenRouter REST API.

You can define all needed variables in .env file in root folder of this application.

## How to use Easy-AI-Router REST API

After deployment of this app on a server, you should have access to it's REST API. For example we will use: your-domain.com.

REST API hosts: 
- OpenRouter: your-domain.com/openrouter/api/v1. Api-Key to access this routes should be provided in headers["access-openrouter"], it is separate from OPENROUTER_API_KEY which is used to get access to OpenRouter's own REST API. Currently "easy-ai-router" uses deepseek/deepseek-r1:free model for chat completion text and google/gemma-3-12b-it:free for chat completion image description. We will expand the ability to choose which model to use in future updates.
