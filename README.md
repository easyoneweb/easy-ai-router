- PORT on which the server will run locally.
- DB_URI is MongoDB URI to connect, example for local default: mongodb://localhost:27017.

- ACCESS_OPENROUTER_API_KEY to access application's REST API for OpenRouter.
- OPENROUTER_HOST is host URL for OpenRouter REST API.

## How to use Easy-AI-Router REST API

After deployment of this app on a server, you should have access to it's REST API. For example we will use: your-domain.com.

REST API hosts: 
- OpenRouter: your-domain.com/openrouter/api/v1. Api-Key to access this routes should be provided in headers["access-openrouter"], it is separate from OPENROUTER_API_KEY which is used to get access to OpenRouter's own REST API. Currently "easy-ai-router" uses deepseek/deepseek-r1:free model for chat completion text and google/gemma-3-12b-it:free for chat completion image description. We will expand the ability to choose which model to use in future updates.
